People are tired of chatbots.\n\n2/ AI is a feature, and it shouldn't be your key selling point anymore \ud83d\udcb8 Everyone has jumped into AI and your product really has to solve a problem to survive\n\n3/ The barrier to entry is almost non-existent. The only limitation is your laziness to get started \ud83d\udca4\n\n4/ You can solve a problem really well if you have faced that yourself. If you are looking for ideas, get yourself in situations where you can encounter problems \u26d1\ufe0f\n\n5/ Boring ideas are the best. Use AI to solve problems of boring businesses and you have a profitable product \ud83d\udca1\n\n6/ Your AI product should not take months and months to launch. AI is rapidly changing and if your product is not out in the open soon enough, it might face the fate of dinosaurs \ud83e\udd96 \ud83c\udf87\n\nWe've built AI products used by thousands daily (developed in weeks!), and some that flopped (developed in months). The difference? Execution \u2728",

And everything worked great.\n\nIn the first year of, I was very much hands-on with engineering. But with the team expanding and new business challenges coming up every other day, it became too hard for me to code myself.\n\nEven though I love it. I love to code, build things, and architect the solutions as a piece of engineering art. But I can't focus too much on it. I can give my input on different projects, help out with some technical decisions, but I can't be very much hands on. If I do, the business might struggle.\n\nSo a couple of weeks ago, a client reached out. They needed help with something that I had never worked on myself. Though our team had worked on such things a lot, so I knew if I failed, our \"rockstar engineers\" would jump in to help this \"rusty engineer\" out.\n\nSpent some days on it, spent the weekend, and.... you can see what the client says in the picture below\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nSo maybe..... I am not that rusty..... yet!\n\nMission \u2705",

They are free to take their profiles with them if they choose to leave.\n\n2 - Not calling ourselves a \"US-based\" company. Neither on our Upwork, our website, or our social profiles. We proudly own and operate as a Pakistan-based \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 software company.\n\n3 - Hiring our engineers on contracts with their own profiles, not just with my profile, hence resulting in many Top Rated Plus Profiles on our Upwork agency account.\n\n4 - Not faking our team's capabilities. Not shadowing junior engineers with the names of senior engineers. Even if that means losing a potential customer. If we can't do something, we communicate that clearly.\n\n5 - Not hiring interns (SEs) to cut costs. Instead, we always hired engineers who had prior experience in full-stack development. As an early-stage company, we can't afford to invest our time in training engineering interns.\n\nAll these steps are very unconventional and considered risky in the agency business. And I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of them. But I was willing to either not grow at all, or grow on the right terms. And I think it worked out decently well for us.",

But I ended up watching the whole playlist ofbyand learnt C++. My first step into programming.\n\nAnd then finally after getting into,, the university I wanted to get in, I could have just gone with the flow, followed the defined path and enjoyed the university life. But I ended up doing freelancing, working on more real world projects before graduation than most people do in their first four years of career.\n\nAnd then after graduating, I could have just lived and enjoyed my life on the nice paychecks I was getting from my jobs. But I continued doing freelancing alongwith all my jobs, making my nights harder and sleepless, while still working honestly and fulltime in my day job.\n\nAnd then I could have just continued doing jobs, switching from one company to the other. But I ended up starting, building a team, with no business experience, no funding or bootstrap money. Taking the constant headache, stress and worry of what the next day is going to be.\n\nAnd then finally.... I mean finally... I could have just taken the easy way out to build the business, shadowing people by faking their experience/names/profiles, but I opted to stay honest to our customers. Showing our capabilities for who we actually are and what we can actually do. The path usually not taken by initial stage companies (or even some mature ones as well)\n\nAnd I am so thankful for all of it. I don't think all of it can be categorized as hardwork. Alot of it is luck and prayers. Many things have to go right for all of it to result in a positive outcome. But I am so glad I could not live the life on auto-mode. And I hope it stay that way.",

You cannot delegate it.\n\nYou can procrastinate if you want to, and you'll have to pay the price for it, but things will never figure themselves out.\n\nAnd I have seen this happen a lot in the past few months.\n\n1. I was worried about losing some recently closed clients. \"What are we doing wrong?\" And it happened a few times before but I never thought much about it. I was confident we'd close more. But I am glad that pride was shattered and I got to look deeper into the problem. And just because I spent time looking into the problem, I figured it was about relationship management and better customer experience. We worked towards perfecting these two things and we improved a lot.\n\n2. Sales were really slowing down, number of leads generated and closed was going down as well, and I decided to just spend 2-4 hours every week with the sales team to look into the issues. Turned out that our outreach had a lot of room for improvement. I did my best to guide our sales team and our numbers finally increased.\n\n3. Everyone wants to build a good public image of their brand. But only very few people are willing to put in the work. I spent a lot of time rethinking our social media strategy, thinking about what we could do to stand out. Now, all the carefully crafted content you see on's profile and website is a result of that thought process and spending many hours per week, thinking about what more we can do.\n\n4. My team has delivered some amazingly complex projects with AI & machine learning. But I was always reluctant to get into it myself. I was a hardcore developer. And somehow, AI became a black box for me. I never spent much time looking into it, assuming that it's beyond me. Until last week. A client reached out with a project where they needed help with some Arabic LLMs. I don't know what got into me, but I decided to take on the challenge myself, spent the weekend cursing myself why I took on the challenge (we all do, right? right?), and finally delivered what the client needed. And now, it's not a black box anymore.\n\nAmazing isn't it? Who could've thought that just putting in the work ..... actually works out!",

Here's the thought process that went behind that release:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 People don't always have their subscriptions in the same currency. Their local apps & mobile data charges are usually in their local currency. So having support for multiple currencies is a must. I brainstormed withand we came up with an approach. So we added support for 100+ currencies in this release\n\n\u2601\ufe0f We got hundreds of downloads \ud83e\udd2f but people weren't signing up \ud83e\udd15 I asked myself, why? We clearly have a \"Login\" button on top of the app. Turns out, users didn't know why they should sign up. What do they get out of it? What features are enabled by signing up? So we added a nice popup showing the user that they will be getting cloud syncing support and will be able to view/manage their portfolio across multiple devices\n\n\ud83d\udcb9 One of the key reasons people will use Track your Subs, is that they wanna know at a glance what they are paying on a monthly basis. Our overview card was nice and simple but something seemed missing. So we revamped the whole card and nicely added the cumulative sums for both current and next month, so users know what to expect next month.\n\n\ud83e\uddf9 And of course, we needed to clean up some bugs and issues that the users reported and made the UI a bit more nicer and cleaner.\n\nIt's been so exciting working on TYS, listening to user's feedback, and implementing them accordingly. I'll try to keep posting about how it goes from an engineering + marketing standpoint as well.\n\nSo... if you still haven't.... then go Track your Subs \ud83d\udcb5\n\nAndroid:\niOS:",

Never. Once.\n\nSince day one, we have engaged our team members directly with our customers.\n\nThe team gets to learn how to effectively communicate with a customer.\n\nThe customer feels like they are being given more transparency about what is being done and by whom.\n\nA win-win for everyone.\n\nSo does that mean that the fear is totally unreasonable? No, I don't think so. Things like these happen. Never happened with us, but they do happen in the world.\n\nAnd they happen because of the following reasons:\n\n- Your team doesn't like working with you or your company. They might fear you, but they don't like you. Which is why they won't care if any of their actions hurt you or your business.\n\u21b3 Solution? Be likable. Work towards the interests of your team as well. Be approachable and make sure they feel comfortable enough to reach out to you whenever needed.\n\n- Clients don't get any value out of working with you. You are just a middleman and you have invested exactly zero number of hours in establishing a relationship.\n\u21b3 Solution? Provide some value other than the manpower to your clients. Be the consultant who is working for them without charging anything extra. Provide your own consultancy as a complimentary service. They should work with your company because of you, not just because of the manpower you have.\n\nIn our lifetime (almost 3 years now), only two of our customers tried to directly hire our team members. And what then happened? In both cases, the team members reached out to us and told us that the customers were offering to hire them directly. And in both cases, the team members preferred staying with us.\n\nI'll just call ourselves lucky, but there might be a pattern to this luck as well.\n\nGo find your own pattern.",

And every step we have ever taken, every policy we have ever made, has been around this one simple goal. \n\n1/ Even though we started with Upwork and our main client base has always been from Upwork, I never wanted to have the culture in my team where everyone is tracking their screens and logging each and every minute of their hands on the keyboard. We clearly communicate with our clients that if you really want to work with us, screen trackers are out of the question. And we have definitely lost a handful of opportunities because of that, but so what? We have a pool of good and decent clients who align with us on this mindset.\n\n2/ In the first few months, when my team members were undergraduates and in their last semester, I clearly asked them to go ahead and apply for other companies. There's a certain fun attached to it. I didn't want to steal this from them. I told them to apply anywhere they want, and whatever offer the industry will be giving at that time, we'll offer more. And we did. And all three of those team members are still with us today. (so proud of it, I know I keep mentioning this in every other post)\n\n3/ We had some really good team members leave us. My process is simple. I talk to them and see if the opportunity is better for them than working with us. And if it is, I encourage them to go ahead and explore the industry. Take on this new opportunity, grow themselves professionally and then come back to us as senior team members.\n\n4/ I have gone as far as advising an interviewee once to go ahead and accept another remote company's offer. Not because he wasn't good, he was one of the most exceptionally talented one I ever interviewed. But as per his goals, that other opportunity was just way too good.\n\n5/ I try to talk to every team member in 1-1 meetings. As a small company, this is our leverage. I get to personally connect to each and everyone, help them with their goals, and try to match our goals with theirs.\n\n6/ I love guiding my team in their own personal projects, products, or issues they are facing with their clients. I have nothing to lose. And it's fun. If they are here helping me figure things out in RipeSeed, I should be there to help them figure out theirs as well. Right?\n\nPeople keep asking me how we have been able to build such a great team, Alhamdulillah. And I think the answer lies somewhere over here. But I think if you genuinely work towards the success and goals of your team, your team will eventually work towards your success and will try and understand your pains as well.\n\nWorked out pretty well for us.",

And that's fine. I respect that. Some people might not be willing to work with agencies and that's fine. All of the clients we have ever worked with knew who they were working with and we kept the team, the processes, and the faces always transparent.\n\nI worked with a client in the early days to help him fix an urgent issue. He was really impressed. He told me he has other projects in the pipeline that he'd like to hire me for. I told him that even though I am the only person in the team right now, I'll later hire more people, and if someone is suitable, he'll be working on the project. That was a deal breaker for him. I tried to convince him but he didn't agree and I had to let him go.\n\nNow I could use the excuse of being the only person in the team to hide the agency, but if I had crossed that line in the early days, that line would have vanished right then and there.\n\nNo one likes to lie. Even the people who do. But if you do it once, it becomes so much easier to do it the second time, and then the third, and by the fourth time, your moral compass is tuned to ignore it altogether.\n\n\"But... but... I am just starting out\"\nYou won't be able to fix your ways if you start the wrong way. Let it start slow. Face the difficulties. You won't know what to fix if you keep ignoring the problem.\n\n\"But it's hard these days\"\nThat's not an excuse to lie to your customers. If everyone starts lying, how do we know who to trust?\n\nGod knows we have said \"No\" to opportunities even in hard times and only God knows how (because I don't) we were always able to get out of the hard times.\n\nThe world becomes a much better place if all of us (or at least the majority) just keep our moral compass in check.",

        "content": "I was always reluctant to work on our products. I was afraid that like many other service-focused companies, we'd end up using these products as filler projects, and won't be able to launch them due to a lack of focus.\n\nOr worse, we'll focus too much on them and our focus will divert from the revenue-generating part of the business (working with clients) to the non-revenue-generating part of the business.\n\nBut then, near the end of 2024, I metand saw the amazing work he was doing, launching his own products and running a profitable business out of it. That served as the first seed of motivation in me to focus on building something of our own. I started following more people on Twitter and LinkedIn and discovered,,, Bhanu Teja (pbteja1998 @ X), and a few more bootstrapped SaaS founders. They were building and shipping like crazy and some of their products skyrocketed.\n\nSo earlier this year when I posted about our achievements in 2023 and our goals for 2024, I mentioned that we'll finally start working on our products.\n\nNow the problem was, what should we build? I was suddenly out of ideas and I could not think of anything meaningful. Wasted a month just writing and scrapping ideas on Notion.\n\nThen I thought to myself, \"Ok, I'll just develop the first thing that comes to my mind, just to get out of this mind-blocker\"\n\nThe criteria was simple:\n- Build something very simple\n- It doesn't have to be world-changing\n- Build something that can be released in 2 weeks\n\nSo the first idea was a recipe app. We built a simple recipe app and launched it, but we didn't announce its launch anywhere. Because the idea was a bit too basic. But that really served its purpose. It opened my mind to more ideas and the next one that came to my mind was:\n\nTrack your Subs \ud83d\udcb5\n\nWe estimated 2 weeks for its development. But it was a bit more complex than we thought. Offline capability seemed crucial. We added a feature to track whether or not you have paid for it or not. But later we scraped that because we wanted to keep it really simple. Too many options make the apps harder to use. We added history, editing records and few more tiny features like these that make the overall experience really good and help keep track of your expenses. Our designers were also occupied with client projects, and those have the highest priority. All these factors contributed to the delay in release.\n\nWhat was originally planned to take only 2 weeks, ended up taking 2 months.\n\nThen finally yesterday, I publically announced the launch of Track your Subs. And we were overwhelmed by the response.\n\nWe got 30 signups, and of course, a feature crashed for some users. Spent a few hours last night releasing a hotfix with. We've got a lot of ideas and feature requests and we are now planning to release some exciting updates soon.\n\nSo... stay tuned!",

We were struggling to close new clients, some of the existing ones ramped down, and as the team size increased, for the first time ever, I started seeing that we might go negative (in revenue) if somehow we didn\u2019t close new clients.\n\nThat stress made me do things that I had never done before.\n\n1. I have always been pushing my team to explore more ways to generate leads, but if you are not good at something yourself (especially in the initial days), it\u2019s really hard to make your team believe that it can work. So in these desperate times, I started engaging more and more on various social platforms, and luckily, to my surprise, I was able to schedule multiple calls and was able to build some good relations.\n\n2. Unlike my usual self, I reached out to Sir, CEO of, a very well-reputed firm, one I am a fan of and I had the chance to work in, asking for mentorship and guidance. To my surprise, he agreed. I met him and discussed all the issues I was facing and the amount of value I got from him was immense. It really opened some doors in my mind.\n\n3. After my meeting with him, I started reflecting on the topics we discussed, and I figured something out. I figured that I was worrying too much about increasing the outreach. Instead, I should have been more focused on the quality of outreach. And this revelation was the best thing I did for our sales early this year. I started conducting 1 hour+ sessions every week with the sales team to review the quality of outreach we were doing, and started giving them my feedback on their approach on a weekly basis. And we saw some amazing results because of this.\n\n4. I reached out to some existing clients of ours and discussed the possibility of longer-term contracts, instead of one-off or ad-hoc engagements. And multiple clients of ours agreed to longer-term engagements.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for this time of panic or stress, I might have never stepped out of my comfort zone and taken these steps to fix these issues.",

They needed to build an MVP for a Health-tech app with a dedicated interface for Patients, Healthcare providers, and key stakeholders. It was the kind of project that every engineer wants to get their hands on and we got super excited to work on it.\n\nI called(the Engineering Lead @ RipeSeed) to start the planning phase of the project and see how we can allocate resources to get this project delivered successfully and \"on time\". Time was the key here. We wanted to make sure that we were not overwhelmed by the huge scope.\n\nSo we started breaking down the features and defined smaller & achievable goals. The first goal was for 2 weeks, where we planned to deliver the patient app, that could allow the patients to input how they feel and point out where they feel the pain in their body in an interactive UI.&started working withto deliver this first phase. Near the end of 2nd week, we felt we might be exceeding the deadline a bit.\n\nAs much as I hate to have my team work overtime and on the weekends, we had a discussion with the team and they understood the nature of the project and deliverables and agreed to go the extra mile. We communicated with the client as well, that we might be a couple of days overdue on the deadline, they agreed and we finally delivered a functional Patient app to the client. This helped boost the morale of the team and we were on our way to the next phases of the app.\n\nThe team was keen on delivering a piece of art with this project, so we took more time than we originally estimated, just because we wanted to do things the right way, even if that meant we'd be off by a couple of days in the delivery. Of course, we kept the communication channel open with the customers and they appreciated that we were prioritizing good engineering over everything.\n\nAnd then finally this month, we delivered the last phase of the project and handed off everything to the client side. The end product was done so well that every stakeholder on the client side appreciated the team's effort and was super happy. And below you can see how the whole team felt after the successful delivery of this project.\n\n~",

We were working with them for a few months already, so I knew there was longer-term potential, but if I didn't intervene then, the relationship was on its way to go downhill.\n\nI messaged them privately and told them they can't talk like this with any of our team members. It's not something we do in our company and it kills the motivation of the engineers who are working hard on delivering a fine product. To my surprise, the customer responded saying they didn't mean to hurt anyone and they might have been harsh with their words, for which they do apologize. In a few minutes, they dropped a message in the group chat apologizing for a harsh tone.\n\nAfter that day, they never turned aggressive and always gave their feedback in a respectful manner. We kept working for them for a few more months and the relationship was better than ever.\n\nWe faced a few more cases like these where I had to jump in and tell the customer that their behavior was not suitable, and luckily for us, in all scenarios, the engagement continued and we didn't lose the customer.\n\nTimes like these test you for who you really are.

If we have to face some stereotypes, so be it.\n\n- Clients don't always like working with agencies. Now we could tell them they can hire someone directly from us and hide a team of engineers behind the scenes, but that's strictly, morally and ethically wrong in my rule book and I've declined so many clients just because of that.\n\n- Clients don't always appreciate that we are a young team of super passionate engineers. Sometimes they are looking for 6-10 Years of experience and we have to respectfully let them go. Lying to them about something we don't have, is a no-go in my rule book\n\n- Sometimes clients are looking for some prior experience, and if we don't have that, we have a strict policy to communicate about what we know and what we don't. \u201cWe feel like we can definitely help you out with it, but if you are looking for experience, we might not be the right choice\u201d\n\n\nPeople don't believe this when I tell them that's how we operate. But go ask anyone at, go ask any of our clients and you'll know the truth.\n\nAnd ever after saying \u201cno\u201d to so many clients, to so many opportunities, we were about to grow to a team of 28 people in the short span of almost 3 years. And I am happy with the progress.",

It actually helped us keep our job and create more in 2023, and it's doing the same in 2024. \n\nChatGPT launched near the very end of 2022, and till then, our skillset, as a company, was mostly in Full Stack Web and Mobile apps development, our team was mostly working on existing products of our clients, acting as an extended team to help them ship faster, or sometimes we were building new products for our clients, to help them validate their ideas.\n\nThen ChatGPT launched and we saw a flood of demand in AI products. Everyone needed to have their own version of ChatGPT or build something on top of it. A client reached out with a very unique idea. It was aimed to improve productivity in professional communications. I had a discussion with my team and looked into the current available APIs from. We told the client that it's NOT under our area of expertise, but we are confident that we can deliver it. The client agreed. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nA few weeks later, the initial implementation was done and the client launched the product in a few more weeks.\n\nThat blew up \ud83d\udd25 For the client, and down the road, for us as well.\n\nThe product started doing really well, since we were very early in the market and solving a real problem. We started showcasing that product as a portfolio to more clients and we started closing more and more projects.\n\nIn 2023 alone, we worked on and shipped 14+ AI based products. This has now become a snowball effect. We have worked on so many basic to advance level projects, solved so many problems, that we are now able to consult the best possible solutions to anyone who's coming up with an AI product idea.\n\nDespite all that fear of recession, we were able to stay in business, grow our team, and up skill ourselves, just because of AI.\n\nAnd the situation is same in 2024. Most of the work we are doing is still on AI.\n\nSo AI never took our job. It actually helped us create more jobs and retain ours.",

Without the help of our amazing UI/UX wizards, we, developers, can mess up the designs pretty bad on our own.\n\nAnd it has happened to us a couple of times. A client once asked us to build a simple one-pager web app, display some simple data on it, just a small simple job, that could lead to some bigger engagements. And he said \"Don't worry about the UI. You can make something bare bone on your own\"\n\nOur developers completed the whole thing, but the UI was just terrible. But they didn't think much of it, since client never asked for it, and they delivered the end product to the client. And the client just got mad. I jumped in, assured them that we'll get the UI improved and delivered a better version in a day, but they kind of lost faith (a bit too soon) and just wanted to end the engagement. We refunded the client and learned this lesson the hard way.\n\nNow we have a base rule.\n\nNo matter what the clients ask for, we have our own quality standards that we have to deliver no matter what. Even if they don't ask for a UI, our UX team will quickly mockup something reasonable enough. Even if they specifically ask not to worry about good practices, we'll follow our own good practices no matter what.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, we'll be known by the kind of work we'll deliver for our clients.\n\nInvesting on delivering quality products is the best marketing investment.",

The very basic level is binary. Then Assembly came in as a layer of abstraction, then C and C++, and then all the other languages that build on top of them. All these languages just allow \"humans\" to instruct computers to perform some specific actions.\n\nDALL-E doesn't run a Photoshop instance to design the images. It just create a bunch of pixels purely based on the data it's trained on and it has learned. Sora doesn't fire up Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe After effects to create videos. It just creates them frame by frame, pixel by pixel, out of nothing. That's how these Large Language Models work.\n\nNow coming back to programming, the Co-Pilot usecase makes a lot of sense, since it's helping people improve their code or review their code. But if we are talking about a complete application being developed by AI, it'll be more like how DALL-E and Sora works.\n\n- You input some prompt to build some features in a web app or mobile or desktop app\n- It just creates an executable binary or return a link for a deployed version for you to play around\n- Maybe it can show you a preview or \"Expo-like\" link where's it's not creating an entire build everytime, but a debug live preview link\n- If you need to make any changes, you can write follow up prompts and it'll just create a new build for you, like \"Hot Reload\" or \"Instant Run\"\n\nMakes sense, right? Think about it!\n\nSorry Devin, no offense!",

The world has enough ReactJS developers\"\n\nBut I think now I need to add to it: \"... and Devin\"\n\nYesterday when I saw the demo of Devin, first thing that came to my mind was:\n\n\"Isn't it just like AutoGPT, but more user friendly?\"\n\nFor those who don't know, AutoGPT launched soon after OpenAI launched GPT-4 and it was basically just a GitHub repo. You set that up locally, add your GPT-4 api keys and run that on a terminal. You allow AutoGPT to perform actions on your behalf and write a prompt of the \"Goal\" you want to achieve. It searched on the internet, researched everything and performed the actions by prompting itself back and forth.\n\nThough the results were not always very reliable (as per my research back then) so it never caught much attention.\n\nYesterday Devin just made everyone, and by everyone I mean all the software engineers, panic. And you should really be panicing if you are not evolving with time. Not learning something new everyday or not keeping yourself up to date with the latest advances in technology. The primitive jobs like building a landing page or a stripe integration or creating a simple mobile app will be replaced soon enough, if they haven't already. Or even a bit more complex ones as well.\n\nBut what about that huge application that a company is already working on, with hundreds of code files, with a DB schema created by \"human software engineers\" (HSEs), with the naming conventions assigned by HSEs, with the architecture that involves integrations from 20 different third party services and involves deployment on a very custom cloud infrastructure. Is this all going be automated with Devin? I won't say it won't be, but the more complex the usecase and the problem, the harder it will be for AI agents to replace the human-element altogether.\n\nSo be a problem solver. If you have been surviving in the software industry with just surface level skills, it's about time you upgrade your skills and make AI the center of your skillset. So if someone who's not using AI can do something in 1 week, you should be doing that using AI, much faster and way better in a day or two (or less? Maybe)\n\nSo let's welcome Devin, whether you like him or not. He has already taken a seat just beside you in your office and he's so eager to compete.",

A much awaited one. \n\nIn the last couple of months, we made some critical policy changes and did some restructuring. The ones that were really hard to do, but had to be done.\n\nAfter all, if you are giving your 9 hours a day (or sometime more) to a company, you deserve to know how it's doing. Is there any growth potential? Why some changes were made? And why some of our amazing team members had to leave?\n\nBefore the All Hands, I circulated an anonymous form in our Slack channel for the questions the team wants to ask us, without having their identities revealed. I literally asked the team to be \"brutal\" with their questions.\n\nSo we started by following up on the promises and the goals we defined in our last all hands, clearly stating which ones we were able to successfully pull off this year, which ones ended up in the bucket of failed experiments, and which ones are still in progress.\n\nLike all initial stage companies (we are 2 years and 8 months old), we made some mistakes. And we acknowledged them. We discussed how we could have avoided them and how we plan to improve going forward.\n\nWe shared the numbers of how we are doing financially. Our revenue for this year was slightly more than last year, but since we scaled the team, our expense increased a lot more and we couldn't hit the revenue goals that we needed to hit to maintain a sustainable & competitive business model.\n\nIt also might have been the recession all around the world, but we can only look at the factors that we can control.\n\nSo we laid down a plan to tackle all of these problems. The plan that's not a product of my own mind, but something I came up with after having discussion with some mentors, reading some books, and trying to find answers online.\n\n- We need to be laser focus.\n- Scale up what's working. Close down what's not.\n- Start disqualifying clients and focus on longer term engagements only\n- Maintain and build better relationships\n\n& the most important of all.\n\nQuality engineering should be our highest priority. Nothing should come in the way of us building highest quality products for our clients\n\nI hope the next All Hands will have more team members, a bigger hall and all revenue goals smashed.

With the resources at his hand, he could run a huge marketing campaign comparing Vision Pro and Meta Quest, launch a video series, like Google did for comparison of iPhone and Pixel, but nope, he just decided to post a casual reel on instagram himself, comparing vision pro to quest, like an influencer.\n\nThis video is just one of the coolest things I have watched today.",

I was able to help him resolve the issue in a couple hours and he asked if I am available for ongoing work on fulltime basis. I agreed.\n\nHe hired me fulltime.\n\nOne month later, he asked if I had another team member available, I had one, and he hired him as well.\n\nWe started delivering good work and about 2 or 3 months later, he asked for more developers, mainly in Angular. I reached out to some contractors and completed the interviews. Ultimately, we ended up onboarding about 5 developers to that client, at it's peak.\n\nAnd all of this happened in first 6 months of the company.\n\nWas that beginner's luck? Yeah I think so.\n\nBut I was really planning to get lucky. I wasn't just sitting idle, waiting for some opportunity to land in my lap. I was looking for prospects, trying to see potential, and applying everywhere I could. I was just increasing my \"probability\" of getting lucky.\n\nI was just reaching out to so many prospects, that I just happen to win by probability. And I apply this rule to this day as well. Do so many random things, so many times, that you ultimately have to win by the laws of probability, even if you lack the capability.",

You can have the perfect logo, a video that catches your audience's attention right away, a PR strategy that shapes the narrative of the audience for your product, exactly as you want, but at the end of day, when your prospect converts to a customer and the product or the service doesn't deliver what was promised, they'll go away, very frustrated with your reputation shattered.\n\n\nIn the journey of any startup or any product, you are always inclined towards doing the \u201ccool\u201d stuff, because everyone else is doing it.

I have been learning about sales, trying out new techniques, reading new books, learning about how to pitch, how to present myself and the brand. You have to learn ins and outs of the sales to properly run a business.\n\nI mean, of course you can hire VP of sales having 10-20 years of experience, but as an initial stage company, you can either not afford that at all, and even if you can, and you are relying on that one individual to bring in cashflow to the company. Congrats, you have just gotten yourself into a bigger problem.\n\nSustainability of YOUR business now lies in the hands of one person, which is not YOU.\n\nIt's a hard to swallow pill, but if you have stepped into business/entrepreneurship, sales is the going to be the only thing that's either going to help you scale, or hold you back.

The team members working on the project talk to the client directly. No middleman. And I received some really good response from my team about this. They were surprised that the company was entrusting them with so much responsibility and giving them ownership.\n\nAnd the result? They tried to protect that trust with the core of their hearts.\n\nHow do I know that?\n\nTwo of our clients tried to offer direct employments to our team members, and my team members reported that directly to me. I never intervened. I let the team member handle it by themselves. They told them it'd be a breach of contract and violation of rules.\n\nI also started trusting my team, from very early on, with company financials. The team prepares financial estimates for the projects, they know what kind of projects we work on, what we charge, and they negotiate with the client on behalf of the company as well, taking client through the whole journey, from discovery, till closing.\n\nAnd this trust has allowed me to unlink myself from day to day of the business and delegate the responsibilities to my team.

I was usually overburdened with the amount of work, so I was handing it off to my friends most of the time, so much so, that at one time, there were 10 projects in progress and I was working on none of them, all being done by my friends. And yes, the process was always transparent and the clients always knew who was working on the project.\n\nWe had a client who wanted us to build web scrappers for him. I started working on that with my friend. We completed more than 10 projects for him and worked with him for over an year. Ultimately, the scrappers started breaking because of various factors. The client started arguing every other day and it seemed like it'd end one day or the other. So one day, I gathered some courage and told him it's not working out for us anymore and we want to end the contracts, even the ones currently in progress that we have worked on. He agreed and ended the contracts.\n\nNext day, I received a bunch of notifications.\n\n\"Your project has been cancelled\"\n\"Your project has been cancelled\"\n\"Your project has been cancelled\"\n.....\n.....\n\nThe client had reversed the payment for all of the work we had done for him over the past year using Paypal chargeback (Google about it and you'll find a lot of victims of chargeback)\n\nI used to withdraw funds from my account every few weeks, so the account only had around $1000 at that time. I lost that amount, plus my account went in negative. Which meant, if I work on any new projects, the earning will be eaten away by the negative balance.\n\nIt took me 2 years to build that account. So many 5 star reviews. All lost, because of 1 bad client. I reached out to support and asked them to check all the 5-star reviews that the client had given us over the past years, but they couldn't do anything because it was a chargeback. It was out of their control (they could file a dispute to Paypal, but I guess they just never bothered)\n\nI had a good enough stream of income at that time, but everything was killed by one client. I was never able to recover that account again, but I had a few clients outside of the platform, so I kept working with them as well.\n\nNow when I look back, I think it was for the good.\n\nI would have never tried Upwork, if my Fiverr account was fine.\nI might have never started RipeSeed, which mainly started as an Upwork Agency.\nI might have never been able to run an agency of 28 people.\n\nAs heartbreaking as that was at that time, I think that was a key factor in who I am today.",

        "content": "Why I am working as a solo founder and don't have partners? I get this question a lot and was planning to document the answer in a post, so here it goes.\n\nKnowing myself well enough, I think I'd have messed up the partnership myself if I had one. Different people have different energies and I think it'll be hard for me, personally, to match my energies with the other person, hence resulting in conflicts later on.\n\nNow, what are the benefits of not having partners:\n\n- Faster Decision Making ~ I can quickly make good/bad decisions, if that works, great, if not, I can pivot without any long discussions.\n\n- No judgments ~ Accept it or not, the human mind does not like to hear no for an answer. If you give an opinion to your partner and he/she says no, the next time, you'll think twice about giving an opinion, which will hinder experimentation.\n\n- Not relying on anyone ~ If I know I am the only one, I'll have no option, no excuse, for not doing something. Sales, engineering, planning, marketing, I know I am the only one responsible. I won't be relying on anyone else.\n\n- Talking less. Doing more ~ I mean, we all love making plans. Romanticizing about the future and the possibilities. Daydreaming. And sometimes, these things start taking up too much of your time. When your partners are your friends, sometimes it can take too much time \"making plans\", and less time \"executing them\"\n\n\nHowever, I think partnerships can be great if done right. Whenever someone asks me, whether or not they should do partnerships, this is what I recommend:\n\n- Build alone. Then merge ~ This will help both of you to validate that you can build something from the ground up. Build something small, make it profitable. Once both of you validate your capabilities, then you can merge. This is especially helpful if both founders have the same area of expertise, which is mostly the case.\n\n- Split responsibilities ~ This helps you stay clear about which person is accountable for which part of the business. If both of you are doing exactly the same thing, one of them will have the leverage to slack off, with the excuse of \"It's being done by him anyway\"\n\n- Make sure your goals align ~ Every individual has personal goals. With partnerships, you have to make sure that those goals, either align or do not come in the way of your mutual goal.\n\n\nHaving partners is great. You can have someone to share the good and bad times with because you cannot always share those successes and failures with your friends and family. But you have to know yourself well enough. If you think you think you can perform well under a partnership, go for it. Everyone paves their own road to their goals. There is no, one, well-defined recipe for success.

The moment you share it, someone else will develop it and make a couple million dollars.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Start with tens of features and don't launch until all of them are developed.\n\n\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Have unrealistic expectations from your development team and push them to deliver results faster than possible. They'll build a bunch of unsustainable garbage so all your features are developed\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Don't define a target market. Your product is for everyone. The whole world needs it. Don't narrow it down to region, industry, and age group.\n\n\ud83d\udebb Have zero public presence. Don't market it on social networks. Just launch and wait for users to discover your product\n\nCongrats. You have successfully failed in launching a SaaS product \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb",

        "content": "No one starts with a rock-solid process. But you gotta start somewhere. A bad process is better than no process at all. \n\nAnd sometimes, having a process can be something as simple as just staying consistent with whatever you are doing.\n\n1. We do twice a week sales meetings, sometimes they feel a bit redundant, but consistent meetings allow us to catch any issues right away. If there is lack of leads generated in any particular week, we all come together and see what we can do to improve it, and most of the time, some minor changes in strategy produce great results.\n\n2. We created our own process of handing off leads from sales to the technical team, it took a few iterations and now the process is pretty solid and the client hardly ever feels inconvenienced with the hand-off.\n\n3. In the early days, we started using Notion to manage all the projects, creating tickets and managing a whole task board in a notion doc. Some might say it's not a \"good practice\", you should always use Jira/Asaana/Trello, but one of our clients, who had the experience of working with a team much bigger than us, complemented as \"You guys are much more organized than the previous ones\"\n\n4. Being an AWS enthusiast, I started training everyone on AWS myself from day one, whenever we hired someone. I created a basic training document and shared it with the team. The team then started training new joiners based on that doc, and kept improving and working on that doc as well. And now we have training docs for AWS, Web 3, Advanced React Training, and many more.\n\nThere is no single formula that can work for everyone. You might have to just create your own recipe, stay consistent about it and make it work. You will never know if something is working on not if you are not following anything consistently.\n\nCreate a process. Stay consistent.\nIf it works, great.\nIf it doesn't, pivot.\nRepeat.",

Didn't think of it much at that time.\n\nA few days later, I decided to post about it in some forums like XDA Developers. No paid marketing or any ASO. I hardly knew anything about ASO at that time. Fast forward a few weeks, and the app got like 50k+ downloads \ud83e\udd2f I wasn\u2019t expecting that at all. Then I checked back again in a few months, more downloads, and to this date, the app has gotten 150k+ downloads \ud83c\udf89\n\nHow? Don't know.

        "content": "How waking up early for a client, helped build a relationship worth $50k+\n\nSix months into's journey, I got to talk to an Australian Health Tech giant, having a big team of developers and researchers. They were planning to automate a huge manual workflow that was consuming billable hours of their own engineers. After a couple of meetings, they agreed to work with me - with one condition. They wanted me to be part of their standup call and needed an overlap of 5 hours.\n\nAustralia is 5 hours ahead of us, which meant I had to be in the meeting at 8:00 AM in the morning. Which also meant that I had to wake up at 6:30 AM, get ready, have breakfast and travel to office, so I can attend the meeting at 8 AM. And I am not an early riser. I can sleep as late as 4 AM, but I can't wake up easily. (Not proud of it)\n\nBut it could be our first enterprise client if I could handle them correctly. So I signed up. Every day in the office, at around 7:45 AM, attending the meetings, working on automating the workflow, establishing a good relationship with our point of contact and the team on their side, and after about a month and a half, we were able to deliver the solution that they hired us for. The engineering manager who hired me showcased workflow in a company-wide meeting and everyone just clapped. And I had never seen them clapping in any of the meetings before.\n\nIt established a strong relationship and trust. The initial contract ended in 3 months, but we stayed in touch if they needed anything from me. And then after 3 more months, they reached out again, with the need for a Senior Full Stack engineer, and we were able to assign one of our team members to work for them. And it seemed like that effort of waking up early was finally paying off.",

Let go of that pride.\n\nWe acquired our first game development client solely because of follow-ups. This client was in talks with several other companies and was uncertain about the approach to their solution. After our initial meeting, we didn't hear from them for about 3-4 days. So I sent a follow-up.\n\nThe client responded right away. They weren't entirely certain if the final product would match their vision. They sought a quick prototype and tools to test their idea.\n\nAfter discussing this with my team, we proposed building a small prototype within a week for the client to validate the core game idea. They agreed, and we initiated a small contract. In just one week, our end result satisfied the client, leading us to secure the full contract to develop the game. That game remains in our portfolio, a showcase for our clients to this day.\n\nWithout that one game, we might not even have a game development team today. And where did it all begin? With that one \"follow-up.\"\n\nThis hypothesis was recently validated when we initiated an outbound email campaign. The \"Open Rate\" for the initial batch of emails was 5%, while the second follow-up achieved a 30% \"Open Rate\".

Build the core value that your product can provide, and that additional feature you very much want to have in your product can be added after the initial release is out. Best of luck \ud83d\ude4c",

        "content": "\"So, I can go home and watch Netflix, but I cannot go home and freelance, is that what you mean?\"\n\nBack in 2019, when I was interviewing for a bunch of companies, I was always surprised when some interviewer or HR said:\n\n\"We don't allow freelancing\"\n\"We have a zero-tolerance policy on freelancing\"\n\nI was like, why? I can go home and play games, I can watch movies, but I cannot freelance? Doesn't make any sense. I want to work on my own thing, I have some personal goals, and I'll make sure that my freelance thing will not interfere with my day-to-day job. So why am I not allowed to freelance?\n\nIt never made sense to me. I got 6 job offers when I graduated, and I made sure to mention my preference to freelance in the interview. I wanted to make this stance clear. I was not planning to lie to the employer and do it anyway.\n\nIn 2021, when RipeSeed started, I started encouraging my team members to do their own thing if they wanted to. I always encouraged them to do freelance if that makes them happy. If they have their own product ideas, they are free to discuss with me anytime they want, and I'll be happy to help to the best of my knowledge.\n\nYou cannot build a great team if your team thinks you don't care about their growth. I am deeply thankful to each and every person working with me, for being with us and helping us achieve so much in the short span of two years. Helping them with their ideas, motivating them to do their own thing and guiding them selflessly is the least I can do for them.",

        "content": "Why I am working as a solo founder and don't have partners? I get this question a lot and was planning to document the answer in a post, so here it goes.\n\nKnowing myself well enough, I think I'd have messed up the partnership myself if I had one. Different people have different energies and I think it'll be hard for me, personally, to match my energies with the other person, hence resulting in conflicts later on.\n\nNow, what are the benefits of not having partners:\n\n- Faster Decision Making ~ I can quickly make good/bad decisions, if that works, great, if not, I can pivot without any long discussions.\n\n- No judgments ~ Accept it or not, the human mind does not like to hear no for an answer. If you give an opinion to your partner and he/she says no, the next time, you'll think twice about giving an opinion, which will hinder experimentation.\n\n- Not relying on anyone ~ If I know I am the only one, I'll have no option, no excuse, for not doing something. Sales, engineering, planning, marketing, I know I am the only one responsible. I won't be relying on anyone else.\n\n- Talking less. Doing more ~ I mean, we all love making plans. Romanticizing about the future and the possibilities. Daydreaming. And sometimes, these things start taking up too much of your time. When your partners are your friends, sometimes it can take too much time \"making plans\", and less time \"executing them\"\n\n\nHowever, I think partnerships can be great if done right. Whenever someone asks me, whether or not they should do partnerships, this is what I recommend:\n\n- Build alone. Then merge ~ This will help both of you to validate that you can build something from the ground up. Build something small, make it profitable. Once both of you validate your capabilities, then you can merge. This is especially helpful if both founders have the same area of expertise, which is mostly the case.\n\n- Split responsibilities ~ This helps you stay clear about which person is accountable for which part of the business. If both of you are doing exactly the same thing, one of them will have the leverage to slack off, with the excuse of \"It's being done by him anyway\"\n\n- Make sure your goals align ~ Every individual has personal goals. With partnerships, you have to make sure that those goals, either align or do not come in the way of your mutual goal.\n\n\nHaving partners is great. You can have someone to share the good and bad times with because you cannot always share those successes and failures with your friends and family. But you have to know yourself well enough. If you think you think you can perform well under a partnership, go for it. Everyone paves their own road to their goals. There is no, one, well-defined recipe for success. Have faith and take the leap \ud83d\ude80",

Notice what's wrong?\n\nI was engaged so much in the day-to-day of the business that thinking about how to grow and experimenting with new things was extremely difficult. But luckily, I was aware of this problem and I was aiming to get out of the day-to-day operations as soon as I possibly could.\n\nWith a bit of effort and spending some time, we were able to build a sales process, that could lift that burden off of me. The sales team was able to reach out to clients, just like me, and we were able to get leads we could convert into clients.\n\nThe next part took time, and it was the responsibility of getting on initial client calls whenever a lead was generated by our Sales team. I was partially worried, but not too focused on solving this problem. Until the end of last year, when I was about to get married. I figured if I didn't lift this responsibility off of me, it would either affect the business or my personal life.\n\nSo we built a Client Success Team, just 10 days before my wedding. A group of extremely talented, skilled engineers, who will be going on the initial client calls, and closing clients on behalf of the company, with the potential of getting bonuses for every client they close. Within a month or two, that team started closing clients, and those \"closers\" started managing their projects as well.\n\nThis has now allowed me to focus on the growth of the company. I have started learning more about sales, reading more books about how to grow the business, doing partnerships to spread the word about our services, attending more networking events, and of course, personal branding.\n\nSo right now, almost 90%, if not more, of my brain capacity is focused on growth and experimenting with new ways to generate sales.\n\nHope this helps anyone who's struggling with a similar problem and can motivate them enough to start focusing on unlinking themselves from the day-to-day of their business as well.",

We had a meeting with the client and everything went well. The client agreed to continue with us. I had a discussion about it with the team and we figured we don't really need a custom AI/ML solution for it. We could just use's APIs. At that time, ChatGPT's official API was not out, so we just used DaVinci model of the Text Completion AI.\n\n\nNow that client was super passionate about his product as well. He didn't just hire us to let us work on it, sit back and relax. He was actively making content on his socials to spread awareness about his product, sharing the whole journey of development. When we showed him some initial results, he made a video on his socials, screaming with happiness \"THEY DID IT!!! \ud83c\udf89\" We were happy, of course, but now the stakes were even higher, because if we messed up, he'd sure as hell announce that in a video.\n\n\nTurns out, the project was delivered on time, everything went much better than expected, and because of the marketing the client was doing already, he got a good number of paying customers within the first month of launch. It was an amazing success.\n\n\n's API was launched much later, and when it did, we replaced the Text Completion with ChatGPT's API and everything kept working as it should.\n\n\nThat proved huge for us. We used that success in our portfolio. Then the Gen AI craze started and the market got saturated with a bunch of startups and products based on Gen AI. Every client we talked to, got impressed with our portfolio and awarded their project to us. We kept delivering successful projects and kept adding to the list of successful Gen AI projects.\n\n\nWe did not make any strategic plans to hop on the Gen AI hype, but somehow, coincidentally, we did, and that proved huge for us.",

We are willing to limit our growth if that\u2019s the cost of being honest and transparent. But if you genuinely ask me about it, I don\u2019t think our growth has been slower. We have been able to grow to a team of 28 people in the short time span of 2 years, Alhamdulillah, and it\u2019s crazy enough for me.",

Nothing else was added to that list after that because I forgot about the list, and that goal really seemed very far fetched.\n\nFast forward to 16th of October, I stepped into Gitex. A massive tech event, happening in. Not CES, but it was everything I imagined a huge tech event could be. Flying car prototypes, super cars, holograms, VR, tech conferences, you name it.\n\nSurrounded with some of the most exceptional minds of this fast moving industry, getting to know the people who have done wonders in Smart Cities, Digital Twins, AI and Holograms, it was a humbling experience. Hope to attend more of these in the future.",

Everyone starting out thinks if they charge lower for their services, they might be able to secure some initial clients. I wouldn\u2019t agree.\n\nClients, the good ones, go for quality. Never for price. See what your industry is already charging and charge the same rate.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcaa Compete on quality, commitment, support, reliability.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Do not compete on price. There\u2019s always someone willing to sell for lower than you.\n\n\nWhenstarted, we had a minimum-maximum range and started saying no to clients in the very early days who were not paying us at least our minimum. Initially, it\u2019s hard to say no when you are starting out. You might close 1 client with your \u201cgood price\u201d rather than closing 5 clients with your \u201clower price\u201d. But it ensures the quality of clients you are adding to your pool. And the pool, eventually, will keep growing.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to up-charge a client who is used to paying you a low price. Not impossible, but pretty hard to convince why you are asking him $10000 for a product when you previously built a similar one for him for $2000. You will never get out of this loop.\n\nBut that being said, I\u2019d totally admit that my situation was different and I was privileged. I had a backup for multiple months that I had saved for the past couple of years with jobs and freelancing. So it was easier for me to say no.\n\nSo my recommendation would be to:\n\ud83d\udcb5 Build a financial backup first\n\u26a1\ufe0f Charge high, so you can pay well to maintain a quality engineering team\n\u2728 Build a reputation for quality & reliability\n\ud83e\udd1d Make sure your clients feel you\u2019ve \u201cGot their back\u201d\n\nStrong financial backing is crucial to build a sustainable business because not every month is equally profitable.

You give me one week to write a post, I\u2019ll finish writing that at the last minute. You give me 1 hour, you\u2019ll have the post ready in 50 minutes. I heard about this law first time in avideo () and since then, I started applying that everywhere.\n\nI noticed sometimes at, we were planning a lot of stuff, but not everything was seeing the light of the day. I found out that we were not \u201ctime-bounding\u201d everything. We might be discussing a lot of stuff, aiming to build a social media strategy and post good content, and tech-reels, but we were not adding a deadline to \u201cwhen we need to do it?\u201d\n\nEarlier last month, I started focusing on that and saw great and instant results.\n\nStarting with myself, I gave myself the goal of writing one post per day. No matter how good or bad. Just one post. It\u2019ll be just me talking about me and what we do as a company. Just have to put them in words. And it started happening. Between 3 to 5 PM every day, my focus is to write a post that I have to publish by 6 or 7 PM. And you can see the consistency.\n\nThen we started focusing on re-shaping ourLinkedIn strategy, thanks to the suggestions from. We started to set a timeframe to create certain kinds of content. We defined a time on a particular day in every week when we shoot the reel, and then we edit and finalize them. We created a backlog of almost a whole month just by following this approach.\n\nSomeone from my team said, I had asked that person to provide me something, but I haven\u2019t received anything from them. And I asked, \u201cwell, did you ask them to deliver that thing to you in 1 hour or any deadline at all?\u201d And the answer was \u201cUmm\u2026 No??\u201d So I sat with them, sent the message with an exact time we needed the deliverable, and guess what? We received it 5 minutes earlier.\n\nThis is one of the biggest life hacks I have recently discovered. Start time-bounding everything. From the smallest to the biggest goals, if you don\u2019t have time allocated to them, they won\u2019t happen.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building RipeSeed, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on LinkedIn, on a daily basis.

That\u2019s just the start of a new relationship, and the real sales work starts after that.\n\nAfter the deal is signed, the client entrusts you with his reputation, his decision to work with you, and your capabilities to deliver what he wants in a well-defined time. If you can prove to him that his decision to work with you is right, you can turn them into a fan from just a client.\n\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Make sure your client\u2019s business goal is being met, with what you are doing for them\n\n\ud83d\udcbc  Your client might be asking for something, not knowing the costs associated with it.

But now that I have to represent RipeSeed, do I want to use this as an excuse for not networking with people, building connections and improving myself? Nope. No chance.\n\nKeeping this in mind, I aimed to visit Dubai in mid-August, with zero experience of networking whatsoever.\n\nBefore my visit, I found a networking event happening atin Lahore. So I thought, let\u2019s just visit as a rehearsal of how I am going to represent the company in Dubai. It went well, and to my surprise, even at that event, I found someone who showed interest in potential collaboration, because a client of his, needed engineering resources. That was a good confidence boost.\n\nThen fast-forward a week, I reached Dubai, and the day I landed, at 4 AM in the morning, I had two meetings lined up for the same day, arranged byand. I showed up, met some very nice people, and made some good friends as well. And this unlocked that challenge that seemed so hard in the beginning. In the days that followed, I was attending 1 to 2 meetings per day, every day, and that visit proved much more beneficial to me than I could ever imagine.\n\nIt seemed so hard in my mind. But being there, representing the thing I have built, knowing that what I am representing stands for the quality that we are proud of, it was not so hard after all.\n\nAnd now, I am visiting again in next week, hoping to make the most out of it.\nWill be sharing the progress and how it goes in the weeks to come.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on, on a daily basis.

The deal comes at the very last. Whenever you are interacting with a new prospect, consider yourself in their shoes.\n\nA good client will always do his due diligence. He is talking to 10 more people other than you, finding someone he can trust with his money or if he is representing his company, he is even more cautious. His organization has entrusted him to choose a provider and your performance (good or bad) will be considered his performance. So his reputation is at stake, which is worth way more than money \ud83d\udcb8\n\nIn one of the videos from, I heard him saying something like:\n\n\u201dBe on the same side as the client. You don\u2019t want to be on the opposite side of him and fight with him. You want to be on the same side as him, and have the problem on the other side, and then help him solve that problem\u201d\n\nOnly if I could find that video again, he explained that so much better. But this advice really changed my perspective. Whenever I go to calls with new prospects, I go with the aim of solving their problem, the deal will follow if we are actually good at it (and it mostly follows)\n\n\nHere are a few things I do to change the ton of any meeting and make it favorable for the prospect:\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Turn on the VIDEO. Show them your face. Show them you are a real human being, not someone shadowing someone else, hiding behind a screen.\n\n\ud83d\ude2c SMILE. It changes the whole tone of the meeting. Your prospect will be at ease and will be comfortable right away. It also shows you are confident in what you are talking about.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Don\u2019t sell your offerings at every word they say. Try and solve their problem. If they trust your word, they\u2019ll ask how you can help them.\n\nAnd the hardest one.\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Learn to say no to things you can\u2019t do. Tell them if you are not the right fit. Wish them luck. They\u2019ll be back with something in the future. The last thing you want is to pick up something you can\u2019t do and embarrass yourself in front of your client.\n\n\nYou start aiming for the hearts of your prospects and they\u2019ll start converting into your clients with deals \ud83e\udd1d\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building RipeSeed, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on LinkedIn, on a daily basis.

I didn\u2019t burn my ships and I was always looking at that backup plan all the time if things went south.\n\n3. I wasn\u2019t focused enough. I had more than 70% of my time dedicated elsewhere.\n\n4. I wasn\u2019t invested myself.

I had 0 experience in public speaking, let alone standing in front of 100 people and delivering an hour-long seminar. But I don\u2019t know how, and I said yes.\n\nI had the week to prepare for it, but I waited till last night (obviously) and then all those fears came up:\n\n- My whole team will be at the event, what if I deliver a terrible speech and embarrass them?\n- What if no one is interested in the whole back story that I think is critical?\n- What if people laugh?\n- I am risking the whole brand image of RipeSeed on this one, possibly stupid, decision of mine. Whatever I do at that seminar will be linked to the name of the company.\n\nI started preparing for it that night. Wrote the whole thing, started rehearsing, and the plan was to have my phone open and deliver the speech. Or at least look at the bullet points.\n\nThe next day I was at the seminar, my team was there and we were just waiting for the exact time. The hall started filling up and since the topic was interesting, the hall filled up with over 100 students. I tested the mic and without overthinking a lot, I started.\n\nAnd then guess what happened?\n\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\nI talked for over 40 minutes, I hardly looked at my phone, was staring at the audience the whole time, was able to crack a few jokes based on some unexpected things happening in the crowd, and made the whole crowd laugh.\n\nOnly if I could explain my happiness at that moment.\n\nBut oh, that, satisfaction \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe whole crowd clapped at the end, appreciated the seminar, and came up with interesting questions as well.

The growth seems consistent, it\u2019s scalable because we are not worried about hiding anything from the client, we don\u2019t hide the leave of the employees or national holidays, if someone is sick, we call in sick on the client side, if it\u2019s a public holiday, we don\u2019t invoice for that day.\n\nThe reason some clients don\u2019t prefer working with companies is because of this bad and very common practice of hiding things, hiding resources, over-selling skills, hiding mistakes, and false testimonials.\n\nWe work on new technologies all the time, but not using a fake testimonial, we show them what we have done and that we feel we are capable of doing this new thing as well. And it works all the time (doesn\u2019t work 10-20% of the time)\n\nWe can transform the whole industry and change this mindset of the clients, the moment we all aim to deliver what we promise, show what we have, and be what we are. It works. That's howworks. We are a living example.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building RipeSeed, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on LinkedIn, on a daily basis.

My mistake. I should have appointed the right person for the job.\n- Someone took a good client of ours? My mistake, we weren\u2019t able to build a relation, strong enough to retain the client.\n- We are not able to deliver on-time? My mistake, I should have taught my team better about how to give better estimations.\n- Our sales target were not met? My mistake. I should have been more in touch with the day-to-day of how sales were going\n- Some critical person left the company? My mistake, I should have been in touch with them about their goals\n- Someone messed up my mood? My mistake, I expected too much from them.\n\nWith this mindset, you start to look for solutions, you start to build processes, so you can avoid making such \u201cmistakes\u201d in the future.\n\nThe key to this thought process is not to blame yourself, but to consider yourself in control of things happening in your life. It creates a problem-solving mindset and you unknowingly start building a process that is immune to any outside negative influence.\n\nHere's the link to that original Gary Vee video:\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building RipeSeed, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on LinkedIn, on a daily basis.

        "content": "Under-promise \ud83d\udcc8 & Over-deliver \ud83d\udcb9\n\nThis is one of our key principles at RipeSeed. One of our ground rules is to tell the clients right away about what we are experienced in and what\u2019s going to be a new problem for us. I adopted this habit back in 2018 when one of my earliest clients approached and asked for a mobile app for private security companies in the US. That problem was very interesting to solve and I had the skills of App development, but I had virtually zero experience with AWS. So this is what I did:\n\nUnder Promise: Had a quick look at the documentation of the services that we\u2019ll be using in the app and told the client that I don\u2019t have any experience with it at all, but I have seen the docs and I think I can do it. The client trusted my word and honesty that I was transparent and awarded the project. I asked for a month to deliver the initial version.\n\nOver Deliver: With the deadline of 1 month, I worked hard to learn everything needed fromside of things and delivered the whole functional app, ready to release in ~25 days. That strengthened the client\u2019s trust in me and that client turned into one of my longest-term clients, whom I still work with to this date.\n\nAnd this strategy has worked for us time and time again. Instead of the general practice of over-promising everything in sales, we do it in reverse fashion.\n\n1. A client was impressed with our previous work for him and asked us to work on Chrome extensions. We told them it was out of our skillset but willing to do it. We outperformed the expectations and the client engaged 5 engineers from our team for his ongoing projects. Now browser plugin development is one of our highest in-demand expertise.\n\n2. We started working on Generative AI back in December 2022 with 0 experience whatsoever and told the client right away. He trusted us, we delivered and now Generative AI is one of our most in-demand skillset and that client always spreads good word for us whenever we put him in referrals.\n\nThis strategy has helped us increase our area of expertise, by maintaining and improving our client relations as well. No good client wants to hear that you are a know-it-all person. Any real person or company cannot have everything under their portfolio. It makes absolute sense to admit what you don\u2019t know, but being open to learning what you can. And if the client only wants someone who has worked on everything that his project needs, he probably isn\u2019t going to prove a patient or a good client in the longer run anyway. So\u2026 best of luck \ud83d\ude4c",

Increase the chances of luck wherever you can!!! \n\nWhenever I tell someone about our journey or how we got some good clients, good team members, good connections, I cannot resist saying \u201cBut I think I got lucky\u201d\n\nAnd I truly mean it.\n\n1. What if I was away watching a season or sleeping or away from my phone when that very good client who was critical for our survival reached out, and I couldn't respond to him right away? What if someone else responded him earlier and impressed him?\n\n2. What if I got into some wrong group of people and went on a wrong career trajectory?\n\n3. What if I underestimated a particular networking event and skipped that, the one from which I got some very good connections?\n\nThe answer to most of these what ifs is same. Increase your chances of luck. In sales, and especially in cold outreach, it's the game of numbers, more than quality. You can write a perfect proposal, but your prospect gets tired after reading 8 proposals and yours was 9th. You can dedicate 2 hours of your day reaching out to new clients, but someone else was dedicating 8 hours of their day and their probability is already 4x yours.\n\nSo even though you cannot control luck directly, you can control the probability of being lucky.\n\nMeet more people, network more, and you only need 1 or 2 people who can prove an excellent connection for you.\n\nSomeone who doesn't network at all, has extremely little (if not 0) probability of meeting someone of value, as compared to someone who met 200 people in 10 networking events in a month.\n\nSomeone who sends 2 proposals a week has very little probability of hearing back from a client as compared to someone putting in the work of sending 100 proposals a week.\n\nSo even though you cannot control your luck, you can surely increase your chances of it. Best of luck!\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am posting the journey of building RipeSeed, the challenges I have faced, and how I solved them, here on LinkedIn, on a daily basis.

        "content": "The Key-Man Problem \ud83d\udd10\n\nEver heard of it? It is a phenomenon when a business or some operations are totally reliant on any one individual, his expertise, his connections and his skills. Remember when in Breaking Bad \ud83e\uddea, Walter White \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\uddb2 said to Skyler in that famous \u201cI am the one who knocks\u2026\u201d scene:\n\n\u201dDo you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me.\u201d\n\nWalt was the Key Man. Is that a good thing? For your self-esteem, maybe, for your work-life balance, for a business to thrive, absolutely not.\n\nIn the early days of RipeSeed, I faced a similar situation. I was the key \u201cEngineer\u201d. Only I knew how to work on complex projects, how to set up CI/CD, or work on complex cloud workflows, but that\u2019s the first thing that you solve in any software services business, right? You train your team and transfer the skills. So that\u2019s what we did and I got out of that. But that was one of the many things we needed to solve.\n\nWhat about sales? The heart of any business. I was doing all of the cold outreach, and I was stuck with it. I was doing the outreach via Upwork and we were doing near-stable revenue, but I had no idea about cold calling and email marketing and that\u2019s when I talked to, I consider him my mentor. Most of what I do, is what I learnt working with(they are amazing, check them out). I asked him how do I scale the sales. And his advice was \u201cJust delegate what you do to your team, don\u2019t do anything new with the sales team, if you are doing upwork, ask your team to do Upwork as well\u201d That was kind of a validation, and I started doing that. We started a sales team, we did some initial training and the team started generating leads which started converting to clients. One more problem solved.\n\nNow I wasn\u2019t doing the outreach, but I was still the one replying to the client whenever a lead responded. For quite some time, it continued on like this. Sales generated leads, and I did the interaction with the client. But I needed to remove myself from this part as well. So we started Client Success Team. A team of super-talented engineers, who\u2019ll do the early interactions with the client, from their OWN account through the Agency (no shadowing, no imitating), whenever a lead responds. This took off.\n\nThe engineering \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb The sales \ud83d\udcb0 The client success \ud83e\udd1d\n\nEverything running without any reliance on any single person. I proudly say that some of our clients don\u2019t even know my name. They know the CSM they are working with and the engineers involved in the project.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to unlink yourself from the day-to-day of your business so you have the time and mental capacity to think how to scale. To do meetups, build longer-term connections, and invest your time in a longer-term play.",

But then it\u2019s harder to scale. To find the team to do what you think only YOU can do \ud83e\udef5\ud83c\udffb\n\nI had been working on Web (Frontend + Backend), Apps, and AWS for around 3-4 years, before I startedin mid-2021. When you are working individually for so long, it\u2019s really hard to trust anyone with the code \ud83d\udcbb You think it\u2019s only YOU, who can do this amazingly complex piece of feature. But you are SO wrong!!\n\nThe first guys I hired left within 2 weeks, my fault, because it was just me and him working side-by-side. He might have felt some pressure. I learned my lesson quickly and the next week, I hired 3 undergraduates. The criteria:\n\n- It won\u2019t be an internship, so the role & responsibilities wouldn\u2019t be like an internship\n- They must be skilled in full-stack development already, apart from being good programmers\n\nSo these 3 people joined the company, who are, I am so proud to say, still with us (thanks,,\ud83d\ude4c). We had some projects going on at that moment, using, CloudFormation,,,, it was a complex SaaS application.\n\nI trained them initially, and I was there with them if they faced any issues because I built that platform with my hands. The nerd inside me was afraid if they could do it or not, but they all surprised me. Now, one can say I got lucky with the team, and I would totally agree \u270c\ud83c\udffb but this has proved time and time again for me. You just have to trust your team with the complex tasks, be with them, guide them and they all can do it.\n\nThe criteria we defined for these first three hires, became the foundation of how we hire. So even when we started growing, the criteria remained:\n\n- We won\u2019t hire someone who we need to train on everything. We train on AWS or DevOps or improve their skills, but they have to bring something to the table, Mobile, Web, or Game Development\n- They have to be open to learning new technologies\n- We don\u2019t have frontend-only or backend-only roles, we hire and maintain a full-stack team\n\nThis is how the engineering team offormed and stands to the strength of 28 people today \u270a The ground rules we defined were carried on by the team, which now interviews and hires on these basic principles.\n\nHow we built the sales team and how we streamlined the sales process is a whole different and very interesting story. Which I\u2019ll cover in some other post. But I hope this answers the question that I get asked very often, How do you hire?",

        "content": "When starting something new, it\u2019s really critical to stay laser-focused on what and why you want to do something. Is it going to be beneficial for your goal or is it going to just look and sound \u201ccool\u201d? I am glad we could avoid most of those things in our early days and till today as well. Some of those things are:\n\nCool Workspace \ud83c\udfe4 Having a cool office space with grass and wooden floors, paintings on the walls, play stations, and a nice book rack in your office, is something that'd really look amazing, but, how critical is that? Is the current look and feel too bad? Should we be channeling our energies into making the office look cool or should we invest that amount in our talent, in bonuses, and in experimentation? The answer was obvious.\n\nThe Product Trap \ud83e\udea4 This is the most critical one I\u2019d say. If you start with the mindset of being a client-service company and you start doing products to keep the team busy, you are doing injustice to the product and to yourself as well. The product mindset is totally different from the services mindset. Starting products will make you feel like the team is \u201coccupied\u201d, you\u2019ll be doing \u201cproduct planning meetings\u201d, you\u2019ll be focused on building a product while finding new clients alongside. You\u2019ll feel like you are busy and doing something, but instead, that won\u2019t be generating any value that's crucial to the survival of the company.\n\nEntertainment \ud83c\udfc4\ud83c\udffd We invest heavily into team satisfaction in forms of competitive packages, a nicer culture, good & and timely (timely is the important part) bonuses, and company-wide monthly dinners. But we never went on a company-wide trip for the whole first two years. The first time we went for one, was on the 2nd anniversary of the company. It\u2019s critical to slowly raise the bar of your entertainment/fun standards, instead of just starting right from the top. This gives you and everyone the sense of validation as well, that we are making progress.\n\nBecoming a US-based Company \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Now I won\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t, but we never really considered registering ourselves outside of Pakistan as something of higher priority. Yes, the majority of our clients are from the US, but we tell them right away that we operate from Pakistan and we have a physical office space here. It never made sense to call ourselves a US-based company when you have never been there and the team is not operating from the US. We proudly work from Pakistan \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 and our clients work with us for quality, trust, and transparency.\n\nNow I won\u2019t say that we will never do the things mentioned above. We will, for sure, as the need arises, but not focusing on them for the good two years helped us stay focused, generate more backup, scale the team by offering better incentives, and I always recommend everyone to do this.\n\nIn some future posts, I'll list the things we did in the early days that I think we could've avoided.",

The rule was to try and scale the business by doing things that \"can scale\". That can prove beneficial to everyone involved in the process. The rules were:\n\n1. Brutal Honesty \ud83e\ude78 We'll stay true to what we can do and what we can't. Even if we want to work on something new, we'll just tell the clients that we don't have the experience but we think we can do it. Clients were always impressed by it and most of the time agreed to it.\n\n2. Quality of Team \ud83d\udcaa We hired the best talent, under-graduates, from the most prestigious IT universities, tried paying them above market for under-graduates at that time, and offered bonuses on top of them. So the ones who got engaged on client projects were financially growing along with the company as well.\n\n3. Tech Stack \ud83d\udcf2 From the very early days, we started training the team on, Web & Mobile development, CI/CD and started engaging them on real-life projects. AWS is not something every fresh grad or undergrad jumps into. But we were setting a higher bar for everyone and that defined a baseline of excellence in the team.\n\n4. Client Transparency \ud83e\udd1d No matter what, we'll provide the transparency of engineers involved in the projects. The client will be provided access to talk to the engineers directly. This proved to be beneficial to us in two ways. The clients were super impressed by the transparency and the team gained experience in client interaction in the very early days of their career.\n\n5. Pay High, Charge High \ud83c\udfe6 We defined a base rate for our services, so no matter what happens, we never cross that threshold. We will always charge above that hourly rate. We will never market ourselves as the cheapest providers. We'll sell ourselves on our quality, our transparency, our honesty and our skills. This helped us maintain a higher-than-market or market-competitive package for our team and retain the team for a longer period of time.\n\n6. Agency from Day 1 \ud83c\udfe4 And boy was it hard to convince the clients to work with agencies!!! But the rule was to always tell them in the first meeting that it's an agency. For some, it was a no-go. But that was our red line. We never tried to acquire any client by presenting ourselves as individuals and hiding a team behind us.\n\nI can write many more pointers but just don't wanna clutter the post.

We are now a team of over 25 people, each and everyone contributing significantly to where we are today.\n\nEvery initial stage company faces a lot of issues while trying to scale up. You are continuously hit by sudden revenue declines, client's ramping down, delivery challenges, and people management issues. Scaling from team of 1 to 4 then 4 to 6, to 10, to 15 to 20 and now over 25, each and every stage required us to unlock a specific set of challenges that we had to face along the way.\n\nBut I believe we got lucky in so many things as well. We are lucky to have such an exceptionally talented team that keeps coming up with ways to improve our technical strengths and deliver quality work. We are lucky to have been able to get new clients whenever we need them. There have been times when some crucial clients just disappeared or ramped down and it seemed like it's going to be hard, but something happened and new even better clients came up and we got back on our track. I consider that an absolute luck and some special sort of blessing upon us.\n\nThe goal has always been to be the \"good ones\". Both to our team and to our clients. We try to actually incentivize the ones who are contributing towards the success of the company instead of just giving them hope that they will be compensated for their contributions. We stay true to our clients by being transparent about our processes and our expertise. We believe in under-promising and over-delivering and apparently, it's been working out pretty well for us.\n\nIt has worked out better than I could ever imagine and fingers crossed for whatever is ahead of us.",

Instead, it just serves the purpose to give you an insight about how the people of world (user's of app to be more specific) are feeling today. The purpose is not user engagement, the purpose is just to provide this simple insight in return to the user's own contribution towards the \"feeling's count\".",
